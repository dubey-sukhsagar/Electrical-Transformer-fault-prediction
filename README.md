Thermal, electrical stress ,Decomposition of insulating material and incipient faults leads to generation of various type
of gases (H2, CH4, C2H6, CO2 etc) inside oil filled transformers. These abnormal operating condition are hard to
detect by normal mechanism.
So task is to classify the faults based on the Dissolve gas
concentration. I took 200 data points attached with paper
H. A. Illias and W. Zhao Liang(1) to train the model.I used
below model/algorithms in different combination to get best
generalised model with high accuracy
